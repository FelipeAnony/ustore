# Getting Started with Ustore

To run this project with the current fake backend that it has, you need to install json-server separately from the other dependencies.

<pre>npm install -g json-server</pre>

After that just install the other dependencies of the project normally with npm install and run it.

<pre>
 cd src/backend json-server --watch db.json --port 5050
 npm start
</pre>
