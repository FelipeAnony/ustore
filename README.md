### Getting Started with Ustore

To run this project with the current fake backend that it has, you need to install json-server separately from the other dependencies.

<pre>npm install -g json-server</pre>

After that just install the other dependencies of the project normally with npm install and run it.

<pre>
 cd src/backend json-server --watch db.json --port 5050
 npm start
</pre>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Currently all pages and resources available in this project are 100% functional, that is, you can login, create an account or post an ad with the fake backend available in the project. But of course, if you want to create a real backend, you won't have big problems, this project was made in an easily detachable way allowing you to change APIs without difficulties.
